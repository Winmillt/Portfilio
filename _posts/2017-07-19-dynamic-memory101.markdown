<b>AboutSnake</b> The most recent project to be completed is the game Snake. the game Snake is an old classix where a player takes control of a 2d (crude outline) snake. The player collects blocks to points on the game as to grow and obtain more points. and can not huit either the edge of the game view board or itself. the bigger the snake gets the more difficult it is as the playerr must think about his or her options when collect points as to not hit themselves.  <!--more-->

<b>Creating Snake Grid</b>

the grid area in which the player is sin will be a 2D array grid in which i hope to change into a dynamic array so that users will be able to create a gride size of their choosing. The grid must stop the player from hitting the edges of the grid as well as dislpay a border so that the player knows not to hit the edges. this can be built with asci art similar to dugeon death which later can be replaced whith a sprite.
